# SHE-website
PLEASE VIEW THIS WEBSITE IN COMPUTER SCREENSIZE (Since we didnâ€™t make all our web pages responsive).
Due to online assignments of various subjects we had only little time to spend for making this website. About 20 pages are present and only one page (login.html) is made responsive. If we had little more time with us, we would have been made it  responsive.

Our website SHE  has sections for
â€¢	About SHE
â€¢	Objectives
â€¢	Login/Sign up (forgot and reset passwords are also included)
â€¢	Contact
â€¢	Search
â€¢	Activities so far(lead the leaders, resume workshop, hackathon)
â€¢	Upcoming events(website making contest, uniform design competition)
â€¢	Testimonials (including a pop-up smilie for feedback)
â€¢	Gallery(sliding) 



Some of the images used as background are not downloaded images(image links), So please Connect to internet while viewing the website..

if you like our website, we assure that in upcoming days we will make it responsiveâ€¦. 

                 THANK YOU ðŸ˜Š

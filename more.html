<div class="boom">
   	<p><b>Government College of Engineering,Kannur<b> has a history of almost thirty years. The college admits 300 students in five branches of study every year and over half of the enrolled are girls and this has remained steady over the years. The majority female students admitted in the past and present have displayed steadfast academic performance and have many a times outnumbered their male counterparts in securing academic laurels such as university ranks. However the unpleasant truth is that a good number of these female academic achievers fail to shine later on in their career and number of alumnae who dwell in the lead roles in jobs are only handful. This dire reality has forced us to put some serious thoughts on the puzzling question “Why So Few?”.</p><br>
   	<p>The future of a country hinges on ensuring that the generations to come are adequately represented, qualified and able to carry the mantle of development forward. Advocating and recognizing women's contributions in technology and the way they collaborate to drive innovation and business growth has to be raised. A leading authority of professional tech savvy women has to be built.</p><br>
   	<p>Thus, <b>‘Scheme for Her Empowerment in Engineering education (SHE)’</b> was introduced by the HR cell of GCEK to bridge this existing gap of women in tech. Through techno-socio initiatives, the scheme aims to equip women to face their future confidently in this rapidly changing landscape. The program has been planned in segments and the first phase of the SHE program has focused on training and mentoring of 50 selected female students. These fifty students are perceived to act as “Peer Leaders” who will propagate and partake in providing training to the remaining girls of GCEK.
   	</p><br>
   	<p>Since its inception, a number of activities have been conducted. One of the first steps taken was the creation of an online network of alumnae, under the name <b>'Women Engineers Connect(WE Connect)'</b>. Starting from the batch of 1990 up to the graduating batch of 2017, an overwhelming response was noted, with more than 200 members joining within the first 5 days. A registration drive and an initial survey was conducted, after which the results were consolidated and analysed. Alongside, an icebreaking and hand holding session was also held for the first target group of female students at GCEK.</p><br>
   	<p>A <b>24 hour Women Hackathon</b> was conducted in collaboration with ,<b>ICFOSS</b>– International Centre for Free and Open Source Software (an initiative of the Kerala Government) and the <b>ISTE</b> Chapter of GCEK. This in-house program, included interaction with alumnae, along with a competitive event that involved building assistive chatbots.</p><br>
   	<p>The <b>'SHE Coders'</b> platform was initiated shortly thereafter, which provided an online platform for students to develop their coding skills with alumnae as mentors. The program provided flexible timing for conducting activities which were designed in such a way so as to familiarize students with industry trends. The first batch of SHE Coders had 20 active participants, who engaged in self and peer-based learning to implement React framework for web development. <b>Training on Matlab</b> was also provided with similar intent, and was concluded with 30 contact hours.</p><br>
   	<p>A <b>workshop on Resume Building</b> was conducted in association with the <b>Rethink Foundation</b>. Through the workshop, it was intended to introduce participants to the nuances of resume etiquette. The day long programme worked towards instilling good resume writing skills, with a focus on exploring job descriptions for each persons dream job while still in college, so as to cultivate the relevant industry skills and create resumes that represent them better.</p><br>
   	<p>The flagship event of the first phase of SHE was <b>'Lead the Leaders'</b>. The two day residential camp for selected 30 SHE senior members aimed to inculcate the much needed skills for professional excellence as well as personal competence. Ultimately, the program sought to mentor the attendees to become leaders for SHE, who would go on to mould the junior members.</p><br>
   	<p>The overwhelming response to the activities of SHE at GCEK has clearly brought out the growing need for extending similar programs to other technical colleges, as well as the need to spread women empowerment for building an inclusive culture.</p><br>

	The coordinators of SHE program have well identified the value of our resourceful alumni and have ensured their fruitful participation in gathering suggestions and information. The other promising contributors to the program are the teaching fraternity of GCEK , resource persons from external agencies and experts from different walks of life. The SHE program also seeks all the support from <b>PTA</b> and the <b>HRD Cell</b> of GCEK.</div>
